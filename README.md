# Spring Batch  Lightmin Server Samples
Sample configuration of batch lightmin server with two clients

## Steps:
 - Download and install the database h2: http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html
 - Start server
 - Create dabatase (I used the relative path of the current user '~/data/batch-server-db' so you won't need any changes)
 - Import maven projects
 - start projects

## Lightmin Server (http://localhost:8080)
see the apps page for the two registered apps
